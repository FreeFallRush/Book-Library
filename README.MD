Project: Library - from The Odin Project Curriculum -> Path (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)

The exercise asks:

- to create a small Library App with a Book constructor function that contains the following parameters: title, author, number of pages and whether the book has been read or not;
- to store all the book objects in myLibrary array
- to write a function that loops through the array and displays each book
- to add new books through a button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details
- to add a button to remove each book displayed in the library
- to add a button that changes the status read/unread of each book when clicked
  This stage requires no storage

Through the Library App project I put in practice what I've learned about constructor functions and got more familiar with how dynamically instances are created. It was also a good exercise to practice more looping through arrays and DOM manipulation (especially the setAttribute and getAttribute, that were very helpful when implementing the toggle button read/unread for each book).
On the CSS side, it helped me practice more using CSS variables and using grid.
